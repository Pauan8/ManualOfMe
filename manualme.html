            <p><h2>Conditions I like to work in?</h1>
                Structured frames on how to work and what to achieve. Though, I also want the environment 
                to feel relaxed and drama-free. Conflicts can of course come up, but they should be dealt 
                with open and honestly in a good way. I want to be able to feel comfortable with my 
                colleagues/study buddies even if the pace of work can be stressful, so we together 
                motivate and help each other. 
                I prefer to work in smaller tight-knitted teams. Communication and sharing are important.

            <p><h2>Times/hours I like to work?</h2>
                Let’s be honest: I am not a morning person. So, if the opportunity to work a bit later 
                in the day rather than be done early is possible, then I chose that. From around 9 a.m. 
                to 18 p.m. is good work hours for me, with the possibility to be a bit flexible and quit 
                earlier some days. I don’t mind taking some extra hours in weekends or evenings to make up 
                for lost time.
                That said – I am a flexible person and can adapt.

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p><h2>The way I like to receive feedback?</h2>
                Be constructive. If you are giving me critic then motivate it, same with positive 
                comments. Don’t tell me exactly how you want me to change things, but don’t be afraid 
                to give ideas on how to. An example: “I am not sure about this header: it feels a bit 
                cluttered to me. Maybe we can remove some of the options and put them in a scroll-down 
                menu instead or what do you think? I do like the background design though; the colour 
                feels so fresh!”

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p><h2>The best way to communicate with me?</h2> 
                Practically: E-mail, chat, message, video chat. I am always fast at responding as 
                I keep my eye on my computer/phone often.<br>
                In what way: Openly, honestly and with a friendly tone. Say what you think but try 
                not to be rude about it. 
                </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p><h2>Things I need?</h2>
                Communication with my team, a strong timeline/plan, agile working, friendly relaxed 
                atmosphere and a decent computer. Other than that, I am adaptable. I am not easily 
                agitated or disturbed, therefor physical working place and hours can be fluid for me.   
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p><h2>Things I struggle with?</h2>
                Working with people who doesn’t communicate with me or a lot of drama. I want to feel 
                comfortable while working/studying and not feel stressed because of a tense environment. 
                I also feel the need to be heard and be able to have an impact on my career and not 
                stagnate.

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p><h2>Things I'm passionate about?</h2>
                To be challenged and evolve! That’s why the IT-field feels so right for me – it is a 
                wide range of companies and roles. I also am a creative person and love design and 
                painting. Programming is of course a passion: I am really intrigued by the different 
                ways to solve things and the optimization of coding to make it as responsive and clean 
                as possible.

            <p><h2>Private interests? </h2>
                Science - <i>I want to know how and why things act like they do, from biomedicine to 
                space physics</i>; board/video/computer gaming - <i> it's a fun way to socialize, 
                strategize and explore</i>; animals; travelling - <i>I am curious about other cultures 
                and environments</i> and anything you need to use your brain - <i>everything from 
                building lego to crosswords to math problems</i>.

            <p><h2>Other things to know about me?</h2>
                I am an easy-going person and not often agitated. When I was younger, I was introvert 
                and found socializing very difficult but over the years I have come into my own 
                and now I enjoy networking and communicating with other people. I also trust 
                myself more and am very motivated, sometimes maybe to the brink of stubborn. I believe
                100% in what I do!
